Ferranteâ€™s inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. The story begins in the 1950s, in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples."},{"title":"My Brilliant Friend","imageUrl":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1223/8976/products/My_Brilliant_Friend_2000x.jpg?v=1478212462","description":"17","price":"Friend is a rich, intense, and generous-hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila."}]
